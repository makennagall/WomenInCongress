README for WomenInCongress

WomenInCongress.py executes a program that distinguishes bills that have key terms contained in their titles. It takes three or four command line inputs: The starting congressional session, the ending congressional session, the file containing API keys (one listed on each line), and the file containing the list of terms to be tested for (one listed on each line). If only one congressional session is being tested, then the program can take in only two inputs: the congressional session and the file containing API keys. The program creates two output files for each congressional session it tests. One output file contains information about bills that contain the key terms. The other output file contains the names of all bills that the program tested, the congressional session the bill was introduced in, and whether or not that bill is contained in the other output file.

termList.txt contains the list of terms used in the most recent collection of data.

requestTest.py takes in one command line input: a valid API key. It prints the html status code that it receives after making a get request. It also prints the data in json format. If the status code is 200, then it will print the data in json format.

WomenInCongress.R contains code that creates graphs using the plotly package.

CompileData.py is a program that compiles the data from different files into one file. It is used to create one file containing data from all the congressional sessions from the separate files generated by WomenInCongress.py.

The OldData folder contains data processed with the key terms listed in OldTermList.txt. The Outputs and allBills folders contains the files outputed by WomenInCongress.py for each congressional session. Outputs contains bills that have one of the key terms in their title. AllBills contains the title of all bills for that congressional session. All files are delimited with the | character. AllBillsNumbers.csv and AllBillsNumbers.xlsx contains how many bills with the key terms and how many total bills were accessed for each congressional session.
AllOutputs.csv and AllOutput.xlsx contains the output for the bills that contained the key terms for all available congressional session in the form:
    title|congress|sponsors|sponsor's party|latest action| date (maybe separated into m, d, y)| pdfURL

WomenPerSession.csv contains tidied data from https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/levels-office/congress/history-women-us-congress
